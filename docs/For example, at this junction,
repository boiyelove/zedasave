For example, at this junction, 
1 hold up is determining if the subscriptions are pre-created or created at runtime and evaluating how that will affect overall speed weighed against how I can leverage the speed with javascript but with the drawback that javascript is client side and that kind of validation (although fast)  can be deadly if no validation is done on server-side. Afterwhich I'll need to figure out if the client should talk to paystack or the server should because if  response time is delayed, the current transaction can be faulted causing an error 500 to the user...          

If I can answer this question, I will be done with this app in 3hours or less 
Yes coding is sweet, however frustrating debugging can be

for i=100 to 5000, 100: daily subscription  types

I think talking to you is cleaning somethings out

for amount it is 100 to 5000 paid daily while target is from 2days to 800days                        
so 50 * 800 = 40,000 possible daily plans                        
                                       
1000 -25,000 = 25
25 * 200 = 5000 possible weekly plans                        
2000 - 100,000 = 50,000
200 * 50,000 = 10,000,000 Possible monthly plans                        
10,000,000 + 40,000 + 50, 000 = 10, 090, 000 possible plans all together
